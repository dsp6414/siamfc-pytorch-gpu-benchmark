## SiamFC on Pytorch

This is the pytorch-version siamfc.

Tutorial notebook is added.

I borrowed some code from Huang's git: https://github.com/huanglianghua/siamfc-pytorch, many thanks.

## Prerequisites

strongly suggest that you need Anaconda Env. And a good Pytorch.

I use a customed training method to reduplicate the result.
