## SiamFC on Pytorch

This is the pytorch-version siamfc.

Tutorial notebook is added.
## Prerequisites

strongly suggest that you need Anaconda Env. And a good Pytorch.

Well I do encountered some issue in trainning my own networks. The result seems a bit worse than the original networks. If you have any idea, feel free to contact me.
